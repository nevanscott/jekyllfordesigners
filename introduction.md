I started using Jekyll for my own personal use because I had grown tired of the setups and migrations required for the CMS-backed setups that I had been using for my professional work making websites for clients. My personal needs were more limited than most of my clients, and above all I wanted something that could work well with my desire to experiment and make changes without losing a sense of what I'd tried in the past.

Jekyll allows you to:

1. **Structure your content without a database.** Websites built using Jekyll are simply a collection of text files. This means that all your code and content is highly portable with requiring the setup of a relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) or a datastore (like MongoDB or Cassandra).
2. **Track your project using Git.** Projects built using Jekyll are easily tracked using Git or other version control tool.
3. **Publish to Github Pages.** While Github Pages as a service may not be around forever, its support of Jekyll makes getting started with Jekyll significantly easier than other static-site generators.

If that sounds good to you, let's get started!
